# Pico Wars: Space Station Battle
This is a de-make of the 1983 classic Atari game, [Return of the Jedi: Death Star Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_of_the_Jedi:_Death_Star_Battle), I changed the name to reflect on the fact that it is being made on the [Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and that anything Star Wars is heavily trademarked. The game is notorius for being confusing garbage, but it is still a classic, and seemed like something fun to remake. I will publish the finished version on the Pico-8 [BBS](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?cat=7), on [itch.io](https://itch.io/), and on my own [Github](https://chand1012.github.io/) page. You can now play the game [here](https://chand1012.github.io/nanowars-spacestation/docs/index.html).

## What needs done
- ~~Enemy sprites~~ Add more enemy diversity
- Better acceleration
- ~~health~~
- ~~the giant shield thing~~
- space station
- get the basic game working
- more sound effects
- publish the game in different places.

## Other Ideas
I plan to make a Pico-8 game mini series called PicoWars, the next game will use identical sprites as a top-down shootemup.
